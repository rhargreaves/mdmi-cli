- Don't add inline comments explaining obvious code
- Don't make unrelated improvements unless explicitly asked
- Don't remove user-added comments
- Don't change naming schemes without explicit instruction
- Don't add comments in code blocks for explanations

- Run and fix all tests after any new feature is implemented or the code is changed.
- Follow strict TDD for new features/fixes
- After test passes, ask me if I want to commit the code
- Update the README.md file after each change but don't bother documenting anything which the user shouldn't care about

- The command for Python on this machine is `python3`
