- Don't add inline comments explaining obvious code
- Don't make unrelated improvements unless explicitly asked
- Don't remove user-added comments
- Don't change naming schemes without explicit instruction
- Don't add comments in code blocks for explanations

- Follow strict TDD for new features/fixes
- After test passes, ask me if I want to commit the code
- Update the README.md file after each change
